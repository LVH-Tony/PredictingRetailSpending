## Data :file_folder:

The data used in this project is from the Automated Retail Spending dataset. The dataset includes features such as income, age, and location. The target variable is the amount of retail spending.

## Model :brain:

The model used in this project is a Random Forest Regressor. It was chosen for its ability to handle complex datasets with many features and for its robustness to overfitting.

## Running the Notebook :computer:

1. Clone the repository to your local machine or server.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/LVH-Tony/PredictingRetailSpending.git
```

2. Navigate to the project directory.

```bash
cd PredictingRetailSpending
```

3. Install the required packages.

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

4. Run the Jupyter notebook.

```bash
jupyter notebook
```

5. Open the notebook in your browser and run the cells sequentially.

## Results :trophy:

The model achieved an R-squared value of 0.85 on the test set, indicating a high level of accuracy in predicting retail spending. The feature importance plot shows that income and age are the most important features for predicting retail spending.
